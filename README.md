## Engineering Philosophy & The Logbook

I build robust and efficient software by applying a rigorous, first-principles approach to computer science fundamentals.
This GitHub profile serves as my public engineering logbook, a transparent and systematic documentation of my work, from foundational algorithms to complex system architecture.

**Mastery is not claimed, it is proven through consistent engineering practice.**

## Asymptora: R&D Lab

Asymptora is the R&D lab founded by my wife, [Janaína](https://github.com/janainacazuza), and me. It's our initiative for researching, developing, and stress-testing production-grade data platform solutions under real-world constraints.
